```

```{r}

# 1st: we observe SMD values all smaller than threshold 0.1
# 2nd: we observe that there are fewer matched pairs (down from 2184 to 1900) because we now used a caliper
# TRADEOFF when using CALIPER: (+) benefit: better matches, meaning smaller smd values (thus lower bias) // (-) drawback: fewer matched pairs, higher variance

```
```{r}
# summary of observations with CALIPER: 
# (1) without the caliper 2184 pairs and risk difference of 0.034 (0.01, 0.062) -> lower variance estimates, see interval range of 0.05.
# (2) with caliper 1900 pairs and risk difference of 0.024 (-0.01, 0.054)
# (3) stat. signficanc vanished: p-value increased from 0.016 up to 0.126
# -> the statistical signficance has been lost due to the better matches -> less bias, but higher variance see interval range of 0.064 = d(-0.01,0.054)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

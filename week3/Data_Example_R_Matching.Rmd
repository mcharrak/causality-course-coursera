This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 



```{r}
# load pacakges
library(tableone)
library(Matching)

# read in data
load(url("https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/rhc.sav"))
# view data
View(rhc)
```


```{r}
#treatment variables is swang1
#x variables that we will use
#cat1: primary disease category
#age
#sex
#meanbp1: mean blood pressure

# variables we will keep
list_keep_var <- c("cat1", "death", "age", "sex", "swang1")

# create new dataset
mydata <- rhc[list_keep_var]

# convert character variables to numerical variables (binary) for cat1 variable
cat1_old_levels <- c("ARF", "CHF", "Cirrhosis", "Colon Cancer", "Coma",
                     "COPD", "Lung Cancer", "MOSF w/Malignancy", "MOSF w/Sepsis")
cat1_new_levels <- c("ARF", "CHF", "Cirr", "colcan", "Coma", "COPD", "lungcan",
                     "MOSF", "sepsis")
cat1_old_new_pair_list <- mapply(c, cat1_old_levels, cat1_new_levels, SIMPLIFY = FALSE)
for (i in cat1_old_new_pair_list) {
  mydata[i[2]] <- as.numeric(mydata$cat1 == i[1])
}

# convert character variables to numerical variables (binary) for other variables
mydata$female <- as.numeric(mydata$sex == "Female")
mydata$died <- as.numeric(mydata$death == "Yes")
mydata$treatment <- as.numeric(mydata$swang1 == "RHC")

# drop used (no more needed) columns/vars from new dataset
mydata <- subset(mydata, select = -c(cat1, sex, death, swang1))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# Data to be used:  Lalonde (1986).
# Task of interest is is in estimating the causal effect of the training program on income.

# install needed packages
#install.packages("tableone")
#install.packages("Matching")
#install.packages("MatchIt")
# load packages
library(tableone)
library(Matching)
library(MatchIt)
```


```{r}
# load Lalonde data from MatchIt
data(lalonde, package = 'MatchIt')

# fix missing variables issue by creating black and hispan variables separately (using the levels form the race varible of lalonde)
lalonde$black <- as.integer(ifelse(lalonde$race == "black", 1, 0))
lalonde$hispan <- as.integer(ifelse(lalonde$race == "hispan", 1, 0))
# now drop race variable
lalonde <- subset(lalonde, select = -c(race))
```


```{r}
### Q1: Find the standardized differences for all of the confounding variables (pre-matching). What is the standardized difference for married (to nearest hundredth)?
xvars <- c("age", "educ", "black", "hispan", "married", "nodegree", "re74", "re75") # do not use re78 because it is the outcome
table1_pre_match <- CreateTableOne(vars = xvars, strata = "treat", data = lalonde, test = FALSE)
print(table1_pre_match, smd = TRUE)
### ANSWER Q1 : 0.72
```

```{r}
### Q2: What is the raw (unadjusted) mean of real earnings in 1978 for treated subjects minus the mean of real earnings in 1978 for untreated subjects?
mean_diff_pre_match <- mean(lalonde$re78[lalonde$treat == 1]) - mean(lalonde$re78[lalonde$treat == 0])
cat(mean_diff_pre_match)
### ANSWER Q2:-635
```
```{r}
# compute prop. score for each subject using the 8 confouding variables; age, educ, black, hispan, married, nodegree, re74, re75.
psmodel <- glm(formula = treat~age+educ+black+hispan+married+nodegree+re74+re75, data = lalonde, family = binomial())
# inspect coefficients of fitted model
summary(psmodel)
# generate propensity scores
pscore <- psmodel$fitted.values
```

```{r}
### Q3: What are the minimum and maximum values of the estimated propensity score?     

cat("Min estimated prop. score is:", round(min(pscore),digits = 3), "and max estimated prop. score is:", round(max(pscore),digits = 3),".")

### Answer Q3: Min. prop. score = 0.009 // Max. prop. score = 0.853.
```

```{r}
# now performing propensity score matching using the Match function of the Matching package
# to make results non-random set seed according to assignment instructions
set.seed(931139)
```

```{r}
### Q4: What is the standardized difference for married?

#  matching options: 1. pair-matching (M=1), 2. without replacement (replace = FALSE), 3. no caliper
# performs matching on the propensity scores themselves (DON'T match on logit(propensity scores)! as done in the lecture R examples)
psmatch <- Match(Tr = lalonde$treat, X = pscore, M = 1, replace = FALSE)
matched <- lalonde[c(psmatch$index.treated, psmatch$index.control),]

xvars <- c("age", "educ", "black", "hispan", "married", "nodegree", "re74", "re75") # do not use re78 because it is the outcome
table1_post_match <- CreateTableOne(vars = xvars, strata = "treat", data = matched, test = FALSE)
print(table1_post_match, smd = TRUE)
### Answer Q4: 0.027
```

```{r}
### Q5: For the propensity score matched data: Which variable has the largest standardized difference?
print(table1_post_match, smd = TRUE)
### Answer Q5: max SMD for variable "black" with 0.852
```

```{r}
### Q6: How many matched pairs are there? 

# re-do propensity score matching from above with caliper value of 0.1
set.seed(931139)

#  matching options: 1. pair-matching (M=1), 2. without replacement (replace = FALSE), 3. caliper value = 0.1 (clp)
# performs matching on the propensity scores themselves (DON'T match on logit(propensity scores)! as done in the lecture R examples)
psmatch_clp <- Match(Tr = lalonde$treat, X = pscore, M = 1, replace = FALSE, caliper = 0.1)
matched_clp <- lalonde[c(psmatch_clp$index.treated, psmatch_clp$index.control),]

xvars <- c("age", "educ", "black", "hispan", "married", "nodegree", "re74", "re75") # do not use re78 because it is the outcome
table1_post_match_clp <- CreateTableOne(vars = xvars, strata = "treat", data = matched_clp, test = FALSE)
print(table1_post_match_clp, smd = TRUE)
### Answer Q6: 111
```

```{r}
### Q7: For the matched data, what is the mean of real earnings in 1978 for treated subjects minus the mean of real earnings in 1978 for untreated subjects? 
mean_diff_post_match_clp <- mean(matched_clp$re78[matched_clp$treat == 1]) - mean(matched_clp$re78[matched_clp$treat == 0])
cat(mean_diff_post_match_clp)
### ANSWER Q7: 1246.806
```

```{r}
### Q8: Use the matched data set (from propensity score matching with caliper=0.1) to carry out the outcome analysis. Carry out a paired t-test for the effect of treatment on earnings. What are the values of the 95% confidence interval?
y_trt <- matched_clp$re78[matched_clp$treat == 1]
y_con <- matched_clp$re78[matched_clp$treat == 0]

ttest_result <- t.test(x = y_trt, y = y_con, paired = TRUE)
cat("The 95% confidence intervals of the risk difference is (", round(ttest_result$conf.int[1],digits = 2), ",", round(ttest_result$conf.int[2],digits = 2),").")
### Answer Q8: -420.0273 2913.64

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
